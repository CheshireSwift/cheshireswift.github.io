      <h1>Figaro</h1>
      <p>Figaro appears to be a well-dressed man in his late 20s. He has an oiled goatee, close shaven black hair and invariably wears a plain black suit and smartly polished shoes over a crisp white shirt. He greets the crew when they recover from their binding, and appears to have at least some idea of what is going on.</p>
