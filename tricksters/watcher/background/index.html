<p>Tricksters choose a purpose when they are born and are beholden to it. This purpose is always some form of disruption, trouble or harm. It can be targeted at an individual, a group, or the world at large, but it must make <em>someone's</em> life harder. Beyond their specific purpose, all tricksters are comforted by being unhelpful, obstructive and contrary whenever possible.</p>

<p>Figaro is a trickster. His chosen purpose is to disrupt the plans of BIG_BAD, which is why he helps the crew and guides the players towards the end of the story.</p>
<pre><code>Hey, you know how I'm working on an RPG setting where a miasma has settled upon the world causing misfortune, as
the manifestation of trickster spirits doing shit to people? (the player characters are otherwise normal people
who have concurrently with this acquired mild magic/super powers, and gained the ability to see the trickster
spirits) (overall aiming for a heroes/antiheroes saving people from harm while working out wtf is going on vibe)
There's quite a bit of overlap; several Jacks, several variations on hares/rabbits and foxes. Several variations
on Wukong (who may be inspired by Hanuman, then you've got Monkey D. Luffy who seems named for him...) I'm aiming
for one word names for each (which will allow deeper cuts on &quot;hey, I get that one&quot; and avoid being too on the
noise/copyright-y), so thinking I might just have kind of a running joke where quite a few of them are called
&quot;Jack&quot;? tbh having a bunch of them be called &quot;Jack&quot; feels like exactly the sort of bullshit trickster spirits
would enjoy Angela Rachel heh Sam It's not really known to the players/definitely not known to the characters, but
their powers come from having merged somewhat with a trickster spirit each. Could use animals for the
&quot;classes&quot;/power bundles mechanically? Fox, Hare, Monkey. Maybe spider? Cunning, fast, disruptive, sneaky
respectively.
